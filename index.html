            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>My name is Ricardo Gabriel Lopez Llerena, I am from Quito, Ecuador. I am 26 years old. 
                I am currently working as an English teacher for Prime English School of Languages. But I have always
                been really interested into learning about programming and web design so that is why I enrolled into 
                the web development bootcamp to see how good I am at programming and hopefully make a career out of it.
            </p>
